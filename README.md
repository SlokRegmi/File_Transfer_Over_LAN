# Secure File Transfer (C++ / Windows)

A robust and secure file transfer utility built using C++ and OpenSSL, designed specifically for Windows systems. It allows encrypted file transfers over TCP sockets with integrity verification and resume support.

## Features

- üîê **AES-256 Encryption** with unique IV per chunk
- ‚úÖ **SHA-256 checksum** for integrity validation
- üîë **Authentication code** for secure pairing
- üîÑ **Transfer resume support** (partially implemented)
- üì¶ **Chunked file transmission** with progress tracking
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Cross-component structure** for reusability and scalability
- ü™ü **Optimized for Windows (Winsock)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- Visual Studio 2022 or compatible
- [OpenSSL for Windows](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) installed

Ensure the following libraries are linked:

```cpp
#pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib")
#pragma comment(lib, "libssl.lib")
#pragma comment(lib, "libcrypto.lib")
```

---

## Build Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.cpp` file in Visual Studio.
3. Link the required OpenSSL libraries (`libssl`, `libcrypto`) in project settings.
4. Build in `Release` or `Debug` mode.

---

## Usage

## Setting Visual Studio Enviroment
```bash
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat
```
(This is usually the path but you might need to alter this according to your path)

## Compilation of the Code 
```bash
cl /EHsc /std:c++17 secure_transfer.cpp /I"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\include" /link /LIBPATH:"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\lib\VC\x64\MD" libssl.lib libcrypto.lib ws2_32.lib

```
(You might need to alter the path of the OpenSSL To run the Code)
### Sender

```bash
program.exe send <filepath> [port]
```

**Example:**

```bash
program.exe send "C:\Users\User\Desktop\file.txt" 8888
```

After running, it will display a 6-digit auth code. Provide this to the receiver.

---

### Receiver

```bash
program.exe receive <server_ip> <auth_code> <save_directory> [port]
```

**Example:**

```bash
program.exe receive 192.168.1.10 123456 "C:\Users\User\Downloads" 8888
```

## Security Highlights

- Password-derived AES-256 encryption key (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256)
- Unique IVs per chunk to ensure data confidentiality
- SHA-256 checksums to verify integrity
- Zero plaintext transmission over network
- Authentication code challenge to prevent unauthorized connections

---

## Directory Structure

All logic is contained in `secure_transfer.cpp`, including:

- `CryptoUtils`: Handles encryption/decryption and hashing.
- `NetworkUtils`: Manages socket operations and protocols.
- `FileTransferSender`: Manages file sending logic.
- `FileTransferReceiver`: Handles receiving and reconstruction.
- `main()`: Entry point and argument handler.

---

## Limitations

- Supports files up to **20 MB**
- Only one file per transfer session
- Designed and tested for **Windows only**
- No GUI ‚Äî CLI only

---

## Future Improvements

- Add GUI wrapper using Qt or WinForms
- Resume interrupted transfers
- Cross-platform support (Linux/Unix)
- Multi-file or folder transfer
- Logging and audit trail
